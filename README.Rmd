# SemiCompRisksBin

The goal of SemiCompRisksBin is to fit Bayesian 'augmented' illness-death models
that account for the possibility of the terminal event occurring 'immediately' 
(i.e., within a very short window) after the non-terminal event via a binary indicator 
and corresponding logistic regression submodel.
