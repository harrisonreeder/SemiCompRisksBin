Title: Software for fitting models to semi-competing risks data with clinically `immediate' events
Version: 0.9.0
Author: Harrison Reeder <hreeder@mgh.harvard.edu>
Maintainer: Harrison Reeder <hreeder@mgh.harvard.edu>
Description: The package provides functions to perform the analysis of semi-competing risks survival data
    in the setting where the terminal event may arise within a clinically-defined 'immediate' window following
    the non-terminal event. We implement a Bayesian MCMC sampling scheme for estimation,
    and implement a variety of tools for model assessment and
    individualized risk prediction using the posterior samples.
